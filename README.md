# Scotland - Taste it! Hike it! Enjoy it!

I took the advice of my mentor and the teachers of the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development Course and I have created a website which I liked and enjoyed the development of it. I was lucky because I could visit this great country with my friends some years ago.

For link to this website click [Here](https://ksagep.github.io/First-milestone-project-Scotland/).

Design has been focused to *Desktop, Laptop and Tablet first* and *Responsive* but it is also working on mobile assets.

## Who is this website for?

This webpage contains information which most of them based on own experience.These information would help for tourists who will visit Scotland. I travelled from Edinburgh up to the Isle of Skye and go back to Edinburgh along the western coast of Scotland. This website is contained the essence of this trip.

## What does this website do?

The website serves as a collection of snapshots. It could help for tourist to provide some proposals when they plan their trip in Scotland. The movie makers chose Scotland many times and the tourist could visit these place (e.g Eilean Dolan castle - Highlander, Glenfinnan Viaduct - Harry Potter, Rosslyn Chapel - Da Vinci Code :) ). The website also provides some ideas what could taste during the visit.

For navigation and footer part of the website the main aim was the big contrast it was the reason why I used #0a0a0a/black on a light background (beige - rgb 245, 245, 220).

I used two types of fonts what I downloaded from the Google Fonts families:

**Tourney** (weight: 700)

### Local testing

The buttons of the website were tested locally and these worked properly.

### Responsiveness

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools for this exercise. I tested for mobile and desktop devices. According to the tool, some images were big for mobile devices and the downloads were slow.

## Version control

I used two repositories during the development: GitPod for local repository and GitHub for remote or background repository. 

I managed the versions with the followung process:
- I created a repository in GitHub
- I opened and developped the repository in GitPod
- I created and developped the files and folders in GitPod
- I saved and pushed my works to GitHub repository:
    1. git add . - adding work to git
    2. git commit -m "Commit message" - to commit the stage of work
    3. git push - to update my work in GitHub

## Publish the project

The steps of the publishing on the GitHub were as follow:
    
    1. **"Settings"** on the repository
    2. **"Source"** of "GitHub Pages" selected *master for Branch* and saved it
    3. The website was published on GitHub Pages and the link was provided in the same section.
